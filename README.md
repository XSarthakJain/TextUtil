# TextUtil
# This TextUtil website is built on Django Framework. It helps us to perform some text/string operation.
# This is basically my first Django Project. I use HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for Front-End and Python Django for Back-End here

# To run this on your local machine first you need to clone this repo "TextUtil".
# Ensure that all the necessary thing for Django and python is available in your machine.
# open CMD/terminal/PowerShell in the project folder.
# run a simple command "Python manage.py runserver".

# Hope You like my work
# contribution and suggestion will be highly appreciated.
